h2. Description

The plugin adds a "Sweep" button to the main toolbar.
One or more folders of temporary files within the current project are configurable in the project settings.
When clicking the button, all files inside selected directories will be deleted recursively.
The plugin settings allow to delete also hidden files and directories, and to exclude some files/directories from deletion using ignore-patterns.

Please note: the plugin is a tool for deleting configured directories and files, it is NOT a shortcut to remotely evoke clearing the cache of a specific browser or other application.
